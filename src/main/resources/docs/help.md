## 3. Courses and Assignments

To expand a course and see the assignments for that course, click on its header. Upon expansion, each assignment displayed includes the assignment name, obtained points by the student, maximum points available, and the deadline.

Clicking on an assignment will take you to the assignment view, where you can view detailed information about the assignment.
